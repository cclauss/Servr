{"name":"Servr","tagline":"A simple HTTP server in Python","body":"# Servr\r\n## Goal\r\nWe made Servr - desktop edition to address an issue. That issue? There are no simple web servers for the masses. Until now. We wanted to make a web server that any person with minimal technical knowledge could use without writing even one line of code. That is what guided us through the process of creating our Servr products.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n### Servr - desktop edition\r\n1. Build a website by hand or using a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) builder.\r\n2. Follow the instructions in README.md\r\n3. Consult the wiki\r\n4. Port forward with your router (try [portforward.com](http://portforward.com) for some good tutorials based on your router model)\r\n5. Buy a domain from a registrar (e.g. [register.com](http://www.register.com), or [hover.com](https://www.hover.com))\r\n6. Register your domain with a DNS provider (a great free one is [afraid.org](http://freedns.afraid.org))\r\n7. Follow your DNS provider's instructions with nameservers (and anything else they tell you to do)\r\n\r\n## Links\r\n[Main website](http://gerzer.net)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
