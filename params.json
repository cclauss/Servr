{"name":"Servr","tagline":"A simple HTTP server in Python","body":"# Goal  \r\nWe made Servr - desktop edition to address an issue. That issue? There are no simple web servers for the masses. Until now. We wanted to make a web server that any person with minimal technical knowledge could use without writing even one line of code. That is what guided us through the process of creating our Servr products.  \r\n\r\n# Usage  \r\n## Servr - desktop edition  \r\n### Serving from Servr - desktop edition  \r\n1. Build a website by hand or using a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) builder\r\n2. Follow the instructions in README.md\r\n3. Consult the wiki\r\n4. Port forward with your router (try [portforward.com](http://portforward.com) for some good tutorials based on your router model)\r\n5. Buy a domain from a registrar (e.g. [register.com](http://www.register.com), or [hover.com](https://www.hover.com))\r\n6. Register your domain with a DNS provider (a great free one is [afraid.org](http://freedns.afraid.org))\r\n7. Follow your DNS provider's instructions with name servers (and anything else they tell you to do)  \r\n\r\n## Servr - mobile edition  \r\n### Description  \r\nServr - mobile edition is the simplest way to run a multipurpose web server from your iPhone or iPod touch. Serve up HTML content right from iOS device. Servr - mobile edition features a simple HTML editor in the uppermost bordered box (mainly meant for you to paste in HTML code from somewhere else), port selection via a text box or a slider (it's your choice), and a live HTML preview using WebKit in the bottom bordered box.\r\n\r\nServr - mobile edition is built from the ground up using the same interface that powers Servr - desktop edition: WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface). WSGI provides Servr a simple, yet powerful, way to serve up your HTML content. \r\n\r\nJust use any browser on the same network as your iOS device, even on that same device, to visit the specified address. Type the address in wherever you would normally type a URL.\r\n\r\nYou can even serve without a Wi-Fi network. Just leave the IP address field blank, and type `localhost:port` (where `port` is the port number you typed into Servr - mobile edition) into the address bar in the browser on your iOS device.\r\n\r\nNote: Servr - mobile edition works best on devices with a 4-inch Retina display.  \r\n### Finding your device's private IP address  \r\n1. Go to the default iOS home screen\r\n2. Tap the iOS Settings icon\r\n3. Tap Wi-Fi\r\n4. Tap the (i) symbol next to the name of the Wi-Fi network your device is currently connected to\r\n5. Your device's private IP address is the text next to `IP Address`\r\n\r\n# Links  \r\n[Main website](http://gerzer.net)  \r\n[Copyright information](/Servr/Licenses.txt)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
