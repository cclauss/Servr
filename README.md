Servr - desktop edition PLUS
=====

**Start by following the instructions at the [Servr homepage](http://gerzer.github.io/Servr).**  
A simple HTTP server in Python (with a tad of Ruby).  
1. Download "Servr - desktop edition PLUS.py".  
2. Make sure Ruby 1.8 or 1.9 is installed. If not, go to [the official Ruby website](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/).  
3. Install [rython](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/rython/) using the Terminal command `pip install rython`, if pip is installed. If pip is not installed, download the archive from the previous link, unzip it, navigate into the unzipped directory in Terminal, and run the Terminal command `python setup.py install`.  
4. Install [Nokogiri](http://nokogiri.org). Follow the instructions from the previous link. You may need to install other Ruby gems such as open-uri.  
5. Create a plain text file called "Config.txt" in the same folder as the Python script you downloaded in step 1.  
6. Modify the file to your needs (see wiki for more info).
